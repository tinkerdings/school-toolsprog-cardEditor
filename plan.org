* *TOOLS PROGRAMMING EXAM* - CARD EDITOR

** *Information*
*** *Delivery information*
- Exam must be done alone
- The code must compile in Visual Studio
- The documentation must be in pdf, doc or docx format.

*** *Exam description*
Create a card editor for card games such as Hearthstone or similar, where
designers can punch in stats for new cards. It must be made in C# using WPF and the
MVVM (Model View ViewModel) design pattern. Also must use MongoDB as database.
The developement process and design decisions must be documentet aswell.

*** *Minimum feature requirements*
1. [ ] One input field for card "name".
2. [ ] One dropdown menu for card "type".
3. [ ] One extra window for creating new "types/card classes"
   - [ ] must contain a input field for name
   - [ ] must contain input fields for default stats
4. [ ] When selecting a "type/card class" for a new card, it should be filled in with
  default values
5. [ ] Must contain at least 3 input fields for numerical stats
   - [ ] Only allows numbers
   - [ ] limit on mininum and maxmimum values
6. [ ] A field that lets the user open explorer to select an image for the card
   - [ ] Only allows image filetypes
   - [ ] The image selected must be shown in the card editor
7. [ ] Button that saves the card in a database when clicked
   - [ ] All field must be cleared when button is pressed to prepare for the next card
    to be made.
8. [ ] A browsing window that lets the user open and look at existing cards
  from the database
9. [ ] Ability to delete cards from the database
10. [ ] Ability to export cards as JSON files.
11. [ ] Ability to import cards from JSON files.

*** *Extra features*
1. [ ] Ability to search for / filter out cards from the database, based on name, type/class
   or stats
2. [ ] In addition to showing card image in editor, also show nice card backgroun graphics
   and stats placed on the card graphic instead of just in input fields.

*** *Documentation requirements*
1. [ ] A thorough description of how the project must be set up, compiled and run.
2. [ ] Which solutions and components where considered and ultimately chosen
3. [ ] Particular challenges/difficulties
4. [ ] elements you are particularily content with
5. [ ] elements you wanted to include, but was not able to, and why.

*** *Technical requirements*
1. [ ] Must be programmed in C#
2. [ ] Must use WPF and MVVM
3. [ ] Must use a database
   - [ ] Must be the database MongoDB 5.0
4. [ ] Must use a JSON-serializer (.NET 5.0 builtin or Newtonsoft Json.NET)

*** *Research needed*
1. [X] Find out how to set up a .NET 5.0 WPF application
2. [X] Find out how to set up a basic MVVM structure for the program
3. [X] Find out how to install and set up Mongo DB
4. [X] Find out how to communicate with MongoDB from C#
5. [X] Find out how to communicate between the MVVM - Model, ViewModel and View
6. [ ] Read through example exams to get a feel for how parts of the program interact
   and communicate with MongoDB
